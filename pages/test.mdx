### VS Code's highlighting

Leverage the accuracy of VS Code's syntax highlighting engine and the popularity
of its themes ecosystem, powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki).
No missing tokens or unexpected broken syntax highlighting.

This is a test.

```js {1-3,4}
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

// ðŸ”¥ Super granular and accurate highlighting
export default function MyDocument() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

Test `<div className="test">{:js}`

  Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a very
  tedious task.
</p>

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.

> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?

  But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
  springing up around the country.

## This is a heading

1. We want everything to look good out of the box.
2. Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3. Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

Now **I'm going to show you** an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:

- So here is the first item in this list.
- In this example we're keeping the items short.
- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.

Let's even style a table:

| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |

And that's the end of our little demo.
